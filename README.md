[![Build](https://github.com/SoftbearStudios/bitcode/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SoftbearStudios/bitcode/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A binary encoder/decoder with the following goals:
- üî• Blazingly fast
- üêÅ Tiny serialized size
- üíé Highly compressible by Deflate/LZ4/Zstd

In contrast, these are non-goals:
- Stable format across major versions
- Self describing format
- Compatibility with languages other than Rust

See [rust_serialization_benchmark](https://github.com/djkoloski/rust_serialization_benchmark) for benchmarks.

## Example
```rust
use bitcode::{Encode, Decode};

#[derive(Encode, Decode, PartialEq, Debug)]
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: u32,
    y: &'a str,
}

let original = Foo {
    x: 10,
    y: "abc",
};

let encoded: Vec<u8> = bitcode::encode(&original); // No error
let decoded: Foo<'_> = bitcode::decode(&encoded).unwrap();
assert_eq!(original, decoded);
```

## Adding Support for Libraries

See the instructions [here](https://github.com/SoftbearStudios/bitcode/wiki/Adding-library-support)!

## Implementation Details
- Heavily inspired by <https://github.com/That3Percent/tree-buf>
- All instances of each field are grouped together making compression easier
- Uses smaller integers where possible all the way down to 1 bit
- Validation is performed up front on typed vectors before deserialization
- Code is designed to be auto-vectorized by LLVM

## `serde`
A `serde` integration is gated behind the `"serde"` feature flag. Click [here](https://github.com/SoftbearStudios/bitcode/wiki/Serde) to learn more.

## `#![no_std]`
All `std`-only functionality is gated behind the (default) `"std"` feature.

`alloc` is required.
